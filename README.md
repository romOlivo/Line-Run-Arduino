<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Simple version of the Line Run game adapted to play with Arduino Uno. 
The hardware was made with the components that have in the "Starter Kit" of Arduino Uno.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To start with, first you need to build the circuit that you can find in "Circuit Diagram.png". 
It is important to respect the pins in the circuit. 
If you change them, you will need to change them also in the code.

### Prerequisites
The proyect uses the libreries LiquidCrystal and pitches. 
If you use the Arduino IDE, you can find this libraries inside the import menu.

### Installation
Open the LineRunGame.ino inside your Arduino IDE and load them in your Arduino Uno.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Simply turn on your Arduino Uno and lets play!
